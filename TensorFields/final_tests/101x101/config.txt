# set window to fullscreen
# windowed is default
# fullscreen

# set window/view size
# size 701 is default

# slice index
slice 8

# threshold for propagation convergence
thresh 0.5

# enables VTK file format: reads "brain.vti" if true, "matrix.txt" if false
vtkFormat 1

# set steps for angular resolution (radres)
steps 32

# define a function for light src #n (counted chronologically/occurence-based) ## ALWAYS CLIP NEGATIVE-VALUED Functions (no negative energies/intensities) --> TODO: ERROR HANDLER
function delta(theta-pi/2)

# use 2.1 for 1/r proportionality test and 2.0 for energy conservation principles for sake of simplicity
