%\input{zusammenfassung}

Tensorfelder werden meistens in Verbindung mit mechanischen Spanunngsverteilungen in 2D/3D-Gittern gebracht (vgl. Cauchy-Stress Tensor), haben aber auch andere praktische Bedeutungen in der Physik.
Mithilfe von globalen Beleuchtungsmodellen/-techniken wird eine neue Methode entwickelt, um Tensorfelder zu visualisieren, die aber zusätzlich auch verwendet werden kann um die Lichtausbreitung in einer topologischen Szene zu beschreiben. Als Grundlage leiten wir ein einfaches Lichtausbreitungsschema für kartesische Gitter ab, dass die Prinzipien der Ausbreitungsdämpfung und Energieerhaltung beachtet und Licht-verteilung/en für gegebene Lichtquellenrichtung/en und -positionen bis zur Konvergenz approximieren kann. Als unterliegendes Modell werden die Transmissionsprofile innerhalb diesem Gitter als Kristallfiberstruktur angenommen (vgl. Edelsteine: Katzenaugeneffekt beim Tigerauge). Die folgende Aufgabe ist es, anisotrope Fiberstrukturen mit der Orientierung und den Anisotropiemaßen des unterliegenden Tensorfelds zu modellieren. Dafür erstellen wir per Hauptachsentransformation (PCA) ein Eigensystem für jede Zelle des Tensorfelds und modellieren eine zugehörige Ellipsengleichung als (Transfer-/Wichtungs-) Transmissionsprofil. Folglich kann die resultierende Lichtverteilung als 2D Skalarfeld oder Polarplots für Richtungsinformation visualisiert/repräsentiert werden. Wir messen Impulsantworten des Tensorfelds mit Delta-Pulsen an jeder Position und in jede Richtung um eine uniform gesamplete Map der globalen Lichtverteilungen zu erhalten. Diese Map wird als ein globales Energieflussfeld betrachtet. Wir lassen uns von der Technik FTLE aus dem Bereich Particle Tracing der Vector Field Visualization inspirieren, indem wir den Gradient des Flussfelds der resultierenden Lichtverteilungen analysieren und visualisieren. Ähnlich wie FTLE in Vektorfeldern Gräte/Kämme/LCS detektiert, erfasst unsere Methode dieselben Strukturen, anziehende/abstoßende/sattelnde Tensorfeldlinien die häufig Schlüsselstrukturen in der Natur repräsentieren, in Tensorfeldern. Wir führen diese Größe als Global Illumination Gradient ein, der einen FTLE-verwandten Ansatz darstellt, um LCS in Tensorfeldern durch die Analyse des globalen, durch einen Imprint (Gravur in kristallinen Fiberstrukturen) gerichteten Lichtflusses, zu visualisieren.

\chapter*{Abstract}
%\input{abstract}
Many problems in science and engineering require
tensor field representations. Tensor fields, are most commonly associated with stress distributions (cf. Cauchy-stress tensor) in 2D/3D grids, but also have some other meanings in practice in physics. By means of global illumination techniques, we motivate a new method to visualize tensor fields, which is also capable of visualizing the light transport (propagation) in a topologically defined scene geometry. As a basis, we derive a simple light propagation scheme for Cartesian grids, which satisfies propagation attenuation and energy-conservation principles and is able to approximate light distributions for given light source position(s) and direction(s) until convergence. The transmission profiles within this grid are considered as crystal fiber structures as an underlying physical model (, eg., gemstones: tiger's eye's cat's eye effect). The consequent task is to model anisotropic fibre structures with the orientation and anisotropy measures of the underlying tensor field in the grid.
For this, we derive an eigenbasis by PCA (principal component analysis) for every cell of the tensor field and form an ellipsoid equation as transmission (transfer/weighting) function for the transmitted light profiles. Hence, the resulting light distribution can be visualized via 2D scalar field color coding or polar plots for directional information. Additionally, we measure impulse responses of the tensor field with Dirac-pulses as light sources at any (sampled) position and in any direction to generate a uniform sampled map of the global illumination distributions. This map is considered as a global illumination energy flow field.
We gain inspiration by vector field particle tracing's FTLE approach for analyzing the gradient of the flow field of the resulting light distributions. Similar to how the FTLE detects ridges/LCS (Lagrangian Coherent Structures) in vector fields (flow fields), our approach captures these structures likewise, namely attracting/repelling/saddling tensor field lines (TFL) which frequently represent key structures in nature, in tensor fields. We denote this entity a light transport gradient (LTG) which states an FTLE-related approach for visualizing LCS in tensor fields through analysis of the global light transport  directed by imprint/engraving in crystelline fiber structures modeled by the tensor field's ellipsoid glyhps. We evaluate our approaches for plausibility and comparability within an extensive test campaign and demonstrate its performance on several examples of datasets.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sect:motiv}
Tensor field visualization is gaining importance as a relevant tool for the analysis of fluid and solid mechanics, where tensor representations are crucially needed. This is always the case, when a directional distribution is needed for a single point in space. Tensors occur most commonly in medical, scientific and engineering applications, making them a frequently used mathematical entity in science. In general, a tensor is a $o$-D generalization of scalar, vector and matrix and appears, e.g., as Jacobian matrix (spatial gradient) in vector (flow) field visualization or as stress tensor in solid and fluid continuum mechanics. Basically, tensors describe compressions, tensions, rotations and volume changes in both solid and fluid material. While most techniques focus on symmetric tensor field visualization (like glyphs and tensor field lines), some other recent works adress the problem of asymmetric tensor field visualization. The issue with asymmetric (non-symmetric) or included antisymmetric (skew-symmetric) tensors is, that they do not always yield real eigenvalues, which is needed to determine an eigenbasis to set up glyphs, hyperstreamlines or tensor field lines (classically). Nevertheless, there has been extensive work in this domain as well. Zheng \& Phang et al. \cite{pang&zheng} proposed the concept of dual eigenvectors and Lin et al. \cite{zhang} extended it to pseudo-eigenvectors and introduced eigenvector and eigenvalue manifold to visualize eigenvectors in the complex domain. In this work, we will use the $\mathbf{U}$-matrix obtained from singular value decomposition (SVD) to obtain the half-axes of the PCA principal ellipsoid representing the tensor transformation as suggested by Moler \cite{moler} to state another alternative of processing asymmetric tensors. 2D tensor field visualization is useful for cases where only two-dimensional data is available, such as satellite remote sensing data, Particle Imagery Velocimetry (PIV) data and earthquake data \cite{laramee}. Additionally, tensor field visualization aids geologists and medical scientists in their field of work to display complicated number arrays which seem almost impossible to interpret in their raw, unprocessed form. Nevertheless, comprehensive visualization is aiding scientists in their everyday lifes understanding complex data loads such as tensor fields. To cope with the arising problem of tensor field visualization, we can only try to invent new methods continuously evaluating them for suitability for certain domains of science to provide our techniques at best considering them for the right applications.\\

The main purpose of visualization in general is to reduce or encode some set of numbers in some readable, explorable and more intuitive representation. This implies, e.g., clustering, structuring or projection techniques. When it comes to tensor fields, this comes in handy in, e.g., medical sciences such as in DT-MRI (diffusion tensor-medical resonance imaging) \cite{hlawatsch}, when measuring water molecule diffusion characteristics within tissue or in simulated (or measured) stress tensor fields from solid and fluid mechanics. In these domains of science the problem arises, that tensor fields can be generated (simulated) or measured with physical/mathematical background, but not be regarded intuitively. Necessity begets ingenuity as always, which lets visualization methods and systems emerge in this context. Concurrently, the problem setting of this work encomprises the visualization of tensor fields, i.e., mostly 2D/3D-grids consisting of mainly second-order tensors (cf. Cauchy stress tensor). These grids span a spatial domain in general with sample positions indicated by vertices. Tensor fields feature a sampling grid consistent of tensors which is spaced uniformly in the commonly used Cartesian grid. A Cartesian grid, which we will utilize in this context, is a normalized uniform grid as a special case of a regular grid. We aim to use global illumination methods to model light transport directed by tensor fields within such type of grids, which we consider as light propagation volumes (LPVs). Congruently, the most basic objective of this work is to design a simple light propagation scheme yet following the most basic but crucial physical principles and laws, like energy conservation and propagation attenuation, for tensor field visualization. Furthermore, it should hold the additional possibility to model light transport in a geometrical scene. This propagation scheme should either be used to visualize the light transport paths (,defined by the anisotropy of tensor fields and tensor magnitudes of a given tensor field in a $2D$ grid. Or, as a secondary purpose, be used to visualize the light transport in a defined, given geometrical scene in a $2D$ grid. However, the tensor field needs to be pre-processed somehow to generate a tensor induced footprint map of transmission profiles, which we will do via matrix decompositions. For this purpose, we will let the transmission profiles act on our simple light propagation scheme to have a kind of tensor controlled directive effect on the light transport. The transmission profiles should modulate the outgoing intensities in a sense of redirection or more appropriately, redistribution. Of course, the propagation scheme will need some kind of stimulus which can be defined through symbolic functions (eg. $r(\omega)=1$) by the user which we sample as a primary step. This way, the approach will operate as a global illumination visualization technique for light distributions in polar coordinates provided the user set an initial profile into the grid. In the sense of automization and optimzation, another consequent aim is to implement an approach borrowed from vector-field visualization to reveal structures, which are hard to graps by ordinary methods. We construct an FTLE-related approach in tensor field visualization (both symmetric and asymmetric) for detecting ridges representing LCS (Lagrangian Coherent Structures). These structures can be classified (identified) as repelling, attracting and saddling (forming a saddle) local features, which frequently represent key structures in nature such as moraines in glaciers. LCS usually separate regions of different flow behavior, but in our case they separate regions/domains of varying directional distributions (manifesting in diverging/converging tensor field lines or higher tensor magnitude) represented by tensors as we use our tensor controlled light transport method as a basis or framework to compute the FTLE field. Thus, we propose another method to compute an FTLE like field on tensor fields. The FTLE map responds most where tensor field lines / hyperstreamlines converge or diverge, whereas one is the same as the other because of bidirectional stress directions and since we effectively measure the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) with both forward and backward integration time (stimulus directions, in our case), we will detect both cases. Both invented methods, will give new insights into the topology and anisotropy of tensor fields and provide tools for the structural analysis. The greater goal of this work is therefore the encoding of a tensor field into certain elaborate representations and the interpretation of meaningful results comparing the proposed techniques against others. The designed approach could e.g. be applied in medicinal sciences, engineering and physics to reveal structures which are hard to grasp through interpreting simpler and sometimes confusing glyph and tensor field line visualizations.

\section{Tensor Fields}
\label{sec:tensors}
Now what is a tensor? A tensor is a $o$-dimensional generalization of a matrix as illustrated in Table \ref{tensor}.
\begin{table}[!b]
\centering
\caption{Tensor Shapes}
 \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
\textbf{order} & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & ... & o \\ 
\hline 
\textbf{shape} & scalar & vector & matrix & ``3D matrix'' & ... & $\mathop{o}$D matrix\\ 
\end{tabular}
\label{tensor}
 \end{table} 
In addition to that, a tensor has as many indices as its order $o$ and their run length is as long as its embedded dimension $n$ in space (the dimension of the row and column vectors), which is equal to the rank of the tensor for full rank (in other words the number of elements n for a $n{\times}n$-matrix). Tensors follow certain transformation rules which are defined for covariant/contravariant tensors, which indicate the change characteristics under a basis change. Contravariant tensors do not change under a change of basis, whereas covariant tensors are not invariant w.r.t. basis changes. Tensors are most commonly obtained and defined from mathematical transformation equations. Hence, any $oD$ number array could be a tensor, but the definition holds only if the transformation rules apply to these $oD$ number arrays (in a sense of mathematical/formal interpretation). This is mostly true for component indexed $oD$ number entities following matrix multiplication and transformation rules found in physics and math manifesting in calculation rules like matrix multiplication. Thus, a tensor in general is a $o$D number array arranged in meaningful (transformation) order to put it simple. In fact, tensors themselves are interpreted as transformations which reflect an incoming direction vector (measuring, e.g., the stress in that direction) to an outgoing (stress) vector. To be a bit more concrete, tensors represent stress distributions in solids and fluids describing strain and flow features as these entities are not simple numbers or vectors. They occur in form of a tensor fields, and thus as entities or quantities in physics. That is, at each point (typically a Euclidean space or manifold) in space (indexed by the grid) there is a whole distribution of directions, e.g., stresses (elastic and viscous), which needs to be characterized and represented by a single tensor each. A tensor is considered non-degenerate if all eigenvalues $\lambda_i>\lambda_{i+1}$ manifesting in significant anisotropy.
 \\
 \paragraph{stress tensor}
 \begin{figure}[!t]
  \centering
 {
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]
    {img/stress_tensor.png}
  }
  \caption{Cauchy stress Tensor}
  \captionsetup{font={footnotesize,bf,it}}
  \caption*{src: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_stress_tensor\#/media/File:Components_stress_tensor_cartesian.svg}}
  \label{cauchy}
\end{figure}

The Cauchy stress tensor, which is propably the classical example of a tensor, is depicted in Fig. \ref{cauchy} and consists of 3 stress vectors $\mathbf{T(e_i)}$ arranged in row-major order. It appears in similar form as viscous stress tensor in fluid mechanics:
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{\sigma}
 = \left[{\begin{matrix} \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_1)} \\
\boldsymbol{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_2)} \\
\boldsymbol{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_3)} \\
\end{matrix}}\right] =
\left[{\begin{matrix}
\sigma _{xx} & \sigma _{xy} & \sigma _{xz} \\
\sigma _{yx} & \sigma _{yy} & \sigma _{yz} \\
\sigma _{zx} & \sigma _{zy} & \sigma _{zz} \\
\end{matrix}}\right]  = \left[{\begin{matrix}
\sigma _x & \tau _{xy} & \tau _{xz} \\
\tau _{yx} & \sigma _y & \tau _{yz} \\
\tau _{zx} & \tau _{zy} & \sigma _z \\
\end{matrix}}\right] =
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma _{11} & \sigma _{12} & \sigma _{13} \\
\sigma _{21} & \sigma _{22} & \sigma _{23} \\
\sigma _{31} & \sigma _{32} & \sigma _{33} 
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}
These 3 stress vectors represent the orientation and magnitude of total resulting stress at plane ${x,y,z}$ in direction ${x,y,z}$ ($3^2=9$ individual numbers). Thus, the stress tensor poses a full valid represenation of the stress distribution at any point in space. The stress tensor itself can be interpreted as a transformation which maps an incoming normal direction vector $\mathbf{n}$ a resulting stress vector $\mathbf{T^{(n)}} = \mathbf{n}\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}$. The stresses in normal directions (diagonal elements) are directly related to the pressure, which is always isotropic and hence non-directionally dependent (kind of a Euclidean distance of the stress components). The tensor itself is a complicated representation and needs to be projected onto its principal axes to lower its dimensionality. It is possible to find 2 principal stress directions in 2D through PCA (see sect. \ref{sec:pca} below), for which there are no shear stresses existent in equilibrium. These form the principal directions of deformation at a certain location and are sufficient to describe the resulting transformation/deformation behaviour. The resulting system of principal directions and absolute stresses is often called an ``eigensystem'' or ``eigenframe''. So to say, an eigensystem, consistent of the principal directions/axes, spans a principal ellipsoid depicted in Fig. \ref{hat} in sect. \ref{sec:pca}.
Another interpretation for the principal component ellipsoid is that it is the result of the tensor transformation applied to the unit circle. It is therefore somehow representing the distortion of an absolutely isotropic object (unit circle) by whatever the affine tensor transformation effects (e.g. stretching, shearing, mirroring, scaling, rotating). Let us consider it as some lower dimensional, more intuitive representation of the tensor which we were left with in the first place. To put it all together, a tensor is a mathematical transformation which is encoded inside of an abstract $oD$ number array, which comes in need, whenever we have a whole distribution of directions manifesting itself in a transformation ellipsoid.

\section{Polar Coordinates}
\label{sec:polar}
\begin{figure}[!t]
  \centering
 {
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]
    {img/polarkoordinaten.png}
  }
  \caption{polar space}
  \captionsetup{font={footnotesize,bf,it}}
   \caption*{src: \url{https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Ebene_polarkoordinaten.PNG}}
  \label{polar}
\end{figure}\vskip 3pt
Mathematically speaking, a polar space is a system which maps each angle $\omega$ a magnitude $r(\omega)$ through a symbolic function. The conversion formula from polar (given a radius $r$ and angle $\omega$) to Cartesian coordinates is depicted in Fig. \ref{polar} and is given by:
\begin{align*}
	x &= r \cos \omega, \\
 	y &= r \sin \omega.
\end{align*}
Note that we switched angle $\phi$ to $\omega$ for reasonable discrimination to the radiant intensity. The inverse direction (given coordinates $x,y$) is a bit more complicated:
\begin{align*}
	r &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\
\omega &= \operatorname{atan2}(y, x)
\end{align*}
The polar domain is a circular axis version of the domain $[0..2\pi]$, with negative magnitudes in $r$ shifted by 180 degrees (point reflected) as this is the formal behaviour defined and required by the conversion formulas.

\section{Principal Component Analysis}
\label{sec:pca}
Note that we denote a matrix with a second order tensor interchangeably for the sake of simplicity in the following. Also keep in mind, that we interpret a matrix or tensor as affine transformation. For any state of stress in equilibrium it is possible to find $n$ (dimensionality) independent orthogonal directions with no shear stresses existent. Along these directions the principal stresses, which are normal (tensile/compressive) stresses, are exerted. The anisotropy can be represented by, e.g., ellipsoid glyphs.

\end{figure}

Principal Component Analysis is an algorithm which can capture the principal components (directions) in stochastic data. But it works similarly on transformations to capture the principal directions from transformations like rotation and scaling. Now, principal component analysis can be done by eigenvalue or singular vector decomposition, whereas the former yields complex eigenvalues for asymmetric matrices. For (skew-) symmetric (normal) matrices, they are connected through the following relation: $s_i = \sqrt{|\lambda_i|}$ (cf. \cite{kieburg}). Note, that the eigenvectors match the singular vectors only for symmetric matrices, which does not mean that they do not form the half-axes of the principal component ellipsoid in other cases. Mathematically speaking, a decomposition is somehow decomposing a transformation (which follows certain transformation rules) into parts of subsequent transformations consistent of rotation and scaling ($\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{R}\mathbf{S}\mathbf{R}^*$). We choose to use singular value decomposition ($\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{V}^*$) to be able to set up real eigenvalues for any kind of matrix (singular values are always real and positive). Also, the singular vectors of the $\mathbf{U}$-matrix represent the half-axes of the principal ellipsoid (eigenframe) shown in Fig. \ref{HAT} for any kind of transformation matrix as pointed out by Moler \cite{moler}. The singular value decomposition is defined as follows:
\begin{align*}
	\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{U} \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{V}
\end{align*}
where
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\mathbf{U}$ is an $m × m$ unitary matrix
	\item $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is a diagonal matrix {$m × n$} with positive real numbers on the diagonal
	\item $\mathbf{V}$ is an {$n × n$} unitary matrix, $\mathbf{V}^*$ is its conjugate transpose
\end{itemize}
 

 In addition, we also calculate the eigenvalues to exploit the sign of the real part of the eigenvalues (\cite{mroz}) ordered decreasingly by absolute value (corresponding to singular value order). The sign corresponds to tensile ($+$) and compressive ($-$) stress, which would allow us to visualize deformation glyphs with arrows pointing inwards for compressive and outwards for tensile stresses. We do this decomposition analysis once for each matrix and then store the precomputed results in a grid. The principal ellipsoid is also used as a transmission profile for the propagation scheme in symbolic form in a subequent step, which makes it a basic and central concept within the scope of this work. In this work, we will use the singular vectors yielded from singular value decomposition to avoid complex values yielded from eigenvalue decomposition. This will allow us to set up glyphs representing the major/minor axis of the underlying transformation for every kind of (asymmetric/symmetric) tensor. We will then use global-illumination techniques on top to generate a light transport flow map, which permits us somehow to forward the intensities which are given as pre-defined initialization values in form of symbolic functions defined by the user. This kind of light transport propagation scheme will also allow us to compute an FTLE-like field on the tensor fields.

\section{Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent}
\label{sec:ftle}
The Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent is a measure developed to analyze time-dependent dynamical systems for their separation abilities concerning massless tracer particles. We imagine a flow field, i.e., a vector field which in turn represents the effective amount or concentration shifted into a particular direction at each point in space. It could induced by e.g. concentration or height gradients. This flow field is considered a time-dependent dynamical system, since it holds a time-component $t$ and thus maps each initial position an aged (altered) position: $\mathbf{\upvarphi}(\mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x}(t_0) \longmapsto \mathbf{x}(t_0+T)$. We can now imagine placing two close by particles with distance $\delta$ into a flow field and run a time dependent simulation. Remark that this corresponds to the Lagrangian view in vector fields, which travels with the particles (instead of a resting observer):

We observe particle trajectories diverging w.r.t. the central axis ending up in distance $\Delta$. The FTLE measure for this single example (point in space) is then defined as:

\begin{align*}
	\sigma = \frac{1}{\lvert T\rvert}\ln \frac{\Delta}{\delta}
\end{align*}

Alternatively, an FTLE can also be computed from a flow map's gradient, which is more convenient to compute in general:
\begin{align*}
	\sigma(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{\lvert T\rvert}\ln \lvert\lvert\nabla\mathbf{\upvarphi(x)}\rvert\rvert _2,
\end{align*}
whereas $\lvert\lvert A\rvert\rvert _2 = \sqrt{\lambda_{max}(A^TA)}$ is the spectral norm of matrix $A$. This will yield a map, which responds most where path lines diverge w.r.t. to a central axis. We consider an example which detects FTLE ridges inside of the cross-section of a double gyre. Note, that this example considers single trajectories diverging implicitly:

Fig \ref{diverge} and \ref{ftle_gyre} depict a scenario of diverging streamlines for a double gyre snapshot in time. Fig. \ref{ftle_gyre} features a high ridge on the margins (borders) and in particular in the center of the domain. This region of interest (ROI) is considered the one with most relative divergence for streamlines by the approach. Ridges also represent Lagrangian Coherent Structures, which are found in nature in vortices of correlating flow behavior.  We could imagine to introduce this process for a whole distribution of trajectories, which would implement an FTLE for uncertain vector fields in a sense, that whole propability distributions of trajectories could be heeded. An overview about existing visualization techniques for uncertain data is given by Griete \& Schuhmann \cite{griete}. We require that the trajectories can cross each other unaffectedly, i.e., the superposition principle is supposed to be respected for the magnitudes. But wait, isn't this behavior somehow familiar? If we elaborately think this through, we can come up with the idea that this is the behavior of light propagation in vacuum. Light paths are physically allowed to cross each other with no influence exerted on each other at all. Consequently, we choose to model the distributions of trajectories as light intensity profiles. That is, we interpret the polar profiles as propability density function (PDF) for particle trajectories heading into this direction. To put it into context, our main contribution method LTG uses the FTLE as an inspiration or template to design a similar approach for tensor field visualization. The main difference to the template FTLE is that we follow eigenvectors instead of flow vectors and that we use whole distributions of trajectories, as a tensor field suggests whole distributions of directions, accordingly.

\end{figure}\vskip 3pt
Glyphs are derived as a basis for the weighting profiles of the tensors in the following propagation scheme. They were chosen because it is an easy-to-use (understand) concept which can also be interpreted nicely. In fact, these reps are used for the principal component analysis of direction vectors for the tensor field line extrapolation (integration) in a subsequent step.
Tensor Field Lines (the type of tensor stream line - hyperstreamline analog that does not introduce artificial intertia) were implemented for Ground Truth (GT) data generation purposes. For example, when we design an FTLE-like field computation approach, we will need to know when tensor field lines diverge/converge.

\paragraph{Test Data (Generation)}
We used python's numpy library to generate pre-defined test cases and caught one real data example from \url{TensorVis.org}, which needed to be pre-processed through slicing and subsequent cropping to 2D samples ($2\times2$) matrices), which can be grouped into symmetric and asymmetric ones:\\

\textbf{Symmteric Tensor Fields}
We also aim to use a real data example of the $3D$ DTI-MRI diffusion tensor of the brain for a male subject at the age of 27. As we visualize 2D symmetric second order tensor fields, we need to slice the dataset and crop the $2{\times}2$ matrices omitting the $z$-component of the original $3{\times}3$ matrices. Fig. \ref{brainglyphs} depicts the glyph representation of the test dataset for slice index $8$:

The ``drain''-Testfield, depicted in Fig. \ref{drain} is generated to have a kind of proof-of-concept (POC) for the FTLE-related approach. It poses raw, bare diverging tensor field lines without any other feature modulated on top. Thus, it can be expected to induce a high FTLE response, since it is an interpretable ground truth test and is considered to be a basic trigger/stimulus for the approach.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

There has been extensive recent work on symmetric tensors but in comparison little on asymmetric ones. Since we aren't able to cover the whole scope in this work, we will focus on the most relevant works on tensor field visualization. We will talk about the publications from Hlawatsch et al. \cite{hlawatsch} and Zirr et al. \cite{zirr} in particular, since they constitute thematically close related works. But first, we will cover related works on global illumination methods, as these forms a basis or prerequisite for our work. Note that they do not focus on tensor field visualization at all. We will inventively employ global illumination methods for tensor field visualization as an innovative step. \vskip 5pt

\paragraph{Global Illumination Methods}
Since we use a specific category of Global Illumination methods as a basis, we decide to only discuss lattice based methods which work, corresponding to their name, on a grid. Remark, that Global Illumination methods classicaly focus on realistic indirect lighting. Thus, they aim on producing a most realistic image, what in our case turns out to be a most informative image in correspondece. The most early work in this field is propably the Discrete Ordinates Method (DOM) by Chandrasekhar \cite{Chandras} which is used specifically for computing radiative transfer in participating media. The radiative transfer equation is discretized spatially and in the angular domain. The radiance distribution (PDF) is stored in a grid and light is distributed and exchanged between neighboring volume elements which reduces the overall effort to local and independent computations. Furthermore, there has been more recent work on describing the light propagation as a diffusion process within a simple photon transport model based the Lattice-Boltzmann method \cite{geist}. DOMs were recently revisited by Fattal \cite{fattal}. This work adresses artifacts stemming from spatial discretization, which are called \enquote{ray effects}, and due to successive interpolation called \enquote{light smearing}. These methods are considered to be too slow to \enquote{run at interactive framerates} by Dachsbacher, though \enquote{efficient and potentially highly parallel}. Our work is inspired by Lattice-Boltzmann methods (volume grid radiosity) and the discrete ordinate methods concerning the light propagation scheme.

\paragraph{Symmetric Tensor Field Visualization}
Zheng \& and Pang \cite{pang&zheng} et al. proposed a texture-based visualization approach called Hyper LIC, which extends the concept of LIC to symmetric tensor fields by using an anisotropic 2D-filter kernel oriented along the major/minor eigenvectors. The concept of following the major/minor eigenvector along tensor field lines was invented by Vilanova et al. \cite{vilanova}. Tensorlines \cite{weinstein} introduce a kind of artificial inertia (running average), making them resistent to noise. The notion of tensor field topology (critical, degenerate points, separatrices) and the concept of Hyperstreamlines was first introduced by Delmarcelle and Hesselink \cite{delmarcelle&hesselink}. The topology in $3D$ tensor fields was first analyzed by \cite{zheng}. The placement of tensor field lines as hyperstreamlines was recently improved by Spencer et al. \cite{spencer} for glyph packing. A good overview of seeding strategies concerning glyphs is given by McLoughlin et al. \cite{mcloughlin}. Feng et al. \cite{feng} used Voronoi Tesselation for placing the glyphs. Superquadric glyphs have been proposed by Schultz and Kindlmann \cite{schultz&kindlmann} for general (non-positive definite) tensors. De Leeuw and van Wijk \cite{deleeuw&vanwijk} visualize the partial derivative gradient, the Jacobian of the tensor field to sense the local properties of the field. A diffusion tensor can also be visualized by box \cite{makris}, ellipsoid \cite{pierpaoli}, composite \cite{westin2} or superquadric \cite{kindlmann} glyphs. There is also a set of scalar measures available in symmetric tensor field visualization such as: mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy \cite{basser} and anisotropy coefficients \cite{westin}. These coefficients can also be visualized by direct volume rendering \cite{kindlmann2}. Hlawatsch et al. \cite{hlawatsch} obtain a coordinate (flow) map from tensor field lines following major/minor eigenvectors (fibre trajectories) and use the maximum eigenvalue of the Cauchy-Green deformation tensor to compute the FTLE-field in homogeneous regions. In a similar manner, we aim to use light transport techniques to obtain a final light distribution through successive light propagation cycles footprinted (in form of transmission profiles obtained from ellipsoid glyphs) by the tensor field. DT-MRI diffusion tensor imaging can help to reveal the functional \cite{denis} or topological \cite{wakana} structure of the brain and muscles by analysing celebral and muscle tissue tractography which yields a tensor field of the anisotropy of the brain's white matter. An overview about DT-MRI visualization techniques is given by \cite{vilanova}. Tricoche et al. \cite{xavier} use invariant manifolds to extract topological features from tensor fields. Other, feature extraction based approaches extract general features as: edges \cite{hancock}, tensor shape\/ orientation \cite{gordon}, interfaces \cite{donnel}, creases \cite{tricochet}.
\\
\paragraph{Asymmetric Tensor Field Visualization}
Zheng and Pang \cite{pang&zheng} proposed the concept of dual eigenvectors and Zhang et al. \cite{zhang} extended it to pseudo-eigenvectors and introduced the eigenvector/eigenvalue manifolds to visualize eigenvectors in the complex domain. Laramee et al. \cite{laramee} focused on the efficient implementation and visualization of these structures and provided an interactive visualization system for asymmetric tensors applicable in fluid and solid dynamics. The concept of tensor magnitude has been introduced by \cite{laramee} for means of physical interpretation. They also proposed an efficient glyph and hyperstreamline hybrid approach, which made dynamic interaction in real-time in 2D tensor fields feasible. Palacios et al. \cite{palacios} extracted isosurfaces of tensor magnitude, mode and isotropy index. \vskip 5pt

Last, we will discuss our work in relation to other publications. While these previously mentioned works use classical approaches like tensor field lines and glyphs, we will also introduce the concept of Lagrangian coherent structures into our framework contribution of tensor field analysis. LCS have been defined as time-dependent analog of separatrices \cite{haller} which are concerned to be robust under noisy conditions \cite{haller2}. Hlawatsch et al. \cite{hlawatsch} obtain similar results (an FTLE-like field) but obtain them by sampling of fiber trajectories instead of global illumination light distributions, as it is the case for this work. Our work shares the same basic idea, deriving and computing a FTLE field for tensor field visualization generalizing FTLE from vectors to tensors, yet using a light propagation scheme and hence using whole distributions of trajectories incorporating polar profiles. It is based on FTLE, and principal component analysis concerning the tensor field visualization method (LTG). We will detect LCS with an FTLE-derived method considering differences in final light transport distributions. The FTLE-related approach named ``light transport gradient'' to be designed also states a generalization of the light transport visualization method FTPD proposed by Zirr et al. \cite{zirr}, since it allows a similar measure to be computed through defining a geometrical scene and setting the transmission (tensor field) to an isotropic and constant value of $100\%$. In this operating mode, the approach operates as a light transport visualization technique neglecting any tensor field transmission profiles.

\chapter{Method}
\label{chap:main}

This chapter will summarize the main contributions of this work studied and state targeted aims and goals as a first step in sect. \ref{sec:overview}. Then we will have a short introduction to the implemented global illumination scheme derived and simplified from an nVidia global illumination approach in sect. \ref{sec:scheme}. Last, we will state the effectively implemented Visualization methods light transport visualization (propagation scheme) and light transport gradient proposed as the main innovatively invented tensor visualization techniques.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:spec} 
Our ambition is to motivate a simple and efficient global illumination propagation scheme able to distribute energy profiles in discrete polar form in 2D/3D-space w.r.t. energy conservation and propagation attenuation principles. We then generate transmission profiles from the eigensystems (principal component frames) of the tensors for each cell in the domain (field). This step is done, to provide an orientation for a lattice of crystal fibre structures (cf. optical fibres) to redirect the intensities in analogy to the anisotropies of the tensor field within a glyph representation, obtained from Principal Component Analysis. Our approach should be implicitly adaptive to any kind of 2D dataset or slices of 3D datasets. Thus, we require it to be compatible to handle any kind of matrix (symm./anti-symm.) and any kind of resolution of the field (fully-adaptive). At last, our ambition is to segment key locations (LCS/ridges) in the field with tensor field lines (hyperstreamlines) converging/diverging, which is necessarily the same (for bidirectional eigenvectors/singular vectors of tensors). Thus, we aim to generate a new FTLE-related method for tensor field visualization by applying a light transport gradient to the resulting light distributions for every possible position and direction of the light source in the grid (lattice) generated by stimulation with Dirac-pulses. Our approach should efficiently handle (relatively) large datasets with reasonable resolutions, which turns out to be possible with additional computing power empowered by a cluster.

\section{Light Transport (Propagation) Scheme}
\label{sec:scheme}
As already discussed, we will design a new method for visualizing tensor fields, which is based on the physical nature of light propagation. For this purpose, we motivate a light transport propagation scheme designed to efficiently propagate initial intensity profiles stored in polar coordinates given as symbolic impulses (stimuli) by the user defined in the configuration file. This polar profiles are first sampled into a vector with elements ranging over the interval $[0,2\pi]$. Polar profiles for different light sources are shown in Fig. \ref{polar}.
\begin{figure}[!t]
  \centering
 {
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]
    {img/strahler.png}

  \caption{Polar profiles for different types of emitters ($m=0$: spherical emitter, $m=1$: Lambert emitter, $m=2$: cone emitter}

  \caption*{src: \url{http://www.optik.uni-erlangen.de/odem/vorlesung/ws1213/Photometrie_Geometrische_Optik.pdf}}
  \label{polar}
\end{figure}\vskip 3pt
As a reminder, polar profiles map each angle $\omega$ a magnitude $r$ forming a function $r(\omega)$. They are circular axis versions of the domain $[0..2\pi]$, with negative magnitudes point reflected by 180 degrees. Thus, they are functions with an angular domain making them directionally dependent, which is a well suited representation for point lights (the type of light source with theoretically no finite extend), as we use them in a style of Dachsbacher et al. \cite{dachsbacher}. For the sake of interpretability, we exclude negative values (energies) from the scope of our calculations which we express through mathematical clip functions, limiting negative values to $0.0$, which we denote by subscript $+$ in the following. We will describe the emission charactersitics of point lights exchanging energies in the lattice by parsing such polar functions. Our grid consists of $\mathop{dim}=\mathop{width}\cdot \mathop{height}$ virtual point lights (VPLs), which are in turn light source with (theoretically) no finite extend represented through polar functions. As a start-up thinker for the propagation scheme, we will think of a grid cell in 2D as a center pixel within an 8-neighborhood with a previously injected point light (imagine a spherical emitter: $r(\omega)=1$ here for simplicity). Inside of this cell, we imagine a circular polar profile of radiant intensities for every angle $\omega$ given in $[\frac{W}{\mathop{rad}}]$. Remember, that all considerations from now on are given concerning a single grid cell respectively. Each cell has 8 (4 faces/edges and 4 diagonals) unique neighbors, which are adjacent point lights in the grid (initialized to $I(\omega)=0$. We consider one face neighbor (top) to shortly explain the steps of the scheme. The diagonals and the others are obtained from derivation and symmetry. Naively, one would consider to just transmit the intensity in the direction its pointing into. But this would omit every propagation attenuation principles (any principles at all specifically), if one takes a closer look:
\paragraph{Accumulation stage}
Each cone type (yellow and green) is an individual neighbor-dependent angular area. The diagonals take in a greater angular domain while they are located at greater distance and thus need to be attenuated more strongly (consider an isotropic stimulus). We aim for distributing contributions for overlapping cones to transmit attenuated (because of the larger factor $\sqrt{2}$ distance) intensity in form of a shared part to the diagonals in a single step (which also prevents from zigzagging diagonal intensities in case we would transmit diagonal intensities around the corner). Therefore, the intensity gathered in polar coordinates inside of angular ranges marked in green, needs to be partitioned between 2 of the 8 cone index neighbors with following considerations:

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \centering
 {
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]
    {img/geogebra-export_large.pdf}
  }
  \caption{Propagation Scheme}
  \label{scheme}
\end{figure}\vskip 3pt

The face neighbors take in the angular domain of $d_1=\alpha+2\beta$ (yellow cone), whereas the diagonal neighbors (green cones) span a domain of $d_2=2\beta$.
The linear combination weights for the overlapping (green) parts ($\beta$) are obtained from the relative overlapping angular area of the angular span $\beta$ w.r.t. diagonal cones ($2\beta$) and yellow face cones ($\alpha+2\beta = 90^\circ$) (yellow cone is overlapped by green cones at full angle). The linear combination weights are subsequently normalized to $\sum = 1.0$ (normalization condition):
\begin{align}
	\varepsilon_\alpha &= \frac{\frac{\beta}{\alpha+2\beta}}{\frac{\beta}{\alpha+2\beta} + \frac{\beta}{2\beta}} \approx 0.362291\\
	\varepsilon_\beta &= \frac{\frac{\beta}{2\beta}}{\frac{\beta}{\alpha+2\beta} + \frac{\beta}{2\beta}} \approx 0.63771.
\end{align}

Remark, that we can precompute these linear combination weights and reutilize them in each iteration. We define the energetic contributions (presuming the cone is given in local coordinates - i.e. centered around the origin) as follows:
\begin{align}
	\Phi_{\alpha} &= \varepsilon_\alpha\int_\alpha {I}(\omega)\mathop{d\omega} =\varepsilon_\alpha(\int_{-\pi/4}^{-\alpha/2}{I}(\omega)\mathop{d\omega}+\int_{\alpha/2}^{\pi/4}{I}(\omega)\mathop{d\omega})+\int_{-\alpha/2}^{\alpha/2}{I}(\omega)\mathop{d\omega}\\
	\Phi_{\beta} &= \varepsilon_\beta\int_\beta {I}(\omega)\mathop{d\omega} = \varepsilon_\beta\int_{-\beta}^{\beta}{I}(\omega)\mathop{d\omega}
\end{align}

\paragraph{Injection stage}
 We place a cosine lobe scaled with the integrated (accumulated) energies in each of the 8 cone directions (angular domains), whereas outgoing integrated and summed energies are weighted by the linear combination weights (factors) in overlapping (green) areas to split up the contributions accordingly. The contribution areas are depicted in Fig. \ref{scheme}, the cosine lobes can be observed in Fig. \ref{iter} respectively. This manner of propagation is inspired by the propagation scheme of Dachsbacher et al. \cite{dachsbacher} (see the paper on how to ``project the flux into a point light''). Basically, we sum up the weighted intensities corresponding to the respective neighbor index and scale an oriented cosine lobe (in direction of the neighbor) with the total flux $\Phi_t$ accumulated inside the neighbor range to transmit all of the parsed intensity for each neighbor distributed into a cosine distribution. We repeat this process once for each neighbor and each cell respectively. When we are done with the whole grid, we just recursively use the result and keep on running propagation cycles. The implementation is done in a dual buffer approach which pushes the energies back and forth (buffer A to buffer B) for each propagation cyvle until a state of convergence is reached, which is the case when the energy is spreaded throughout the grid and enters a stationary state of equilibrium, characterized by equal out (at grid borders) to in (at light source positions) energy-flow with no more nettings going on inside the domain. We measure the convergence by setting up an overall distribution error w.r.t to the previous iteration. Note that even though we propagate the energy directly through the diagonal cones (which forms a square initially), the 8 degrees of freedom introduce a circular (spherical) wave front after few iterations (for greater resolutions) as depicted in Fig. \ref{iter}. This occurs, because of a faster propagation attenuation which counteracts the larger angle of diagonal cones. There is a redistribution of intensities in the long term resulting in a, since the shared part effects a uniformly spaced isotropic propagation profile resulting in a circular torus-shaped distribution of intensities, as also observed in Fig. \ref{iter}. Also note, that this approach satisfies energy conservation and propagation attenuation principles and applies to the principles of light propagation in vacuum (by default). We infer, that we can assume to follow physical models of spherical waves. The verification of these principal requirements and specifications can be observed in the evaluation in chap. \ref{chap:eval}. We first show the approach for a few iterations with a manual stop criterion to have a kind of imagination for the propagation process:

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \centering
 {
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]
    {img/steps_gallery_format_arrow_alt.png}
  }
  \caption{Impulse response for isotropic stimulus (few iteration snaphots: $t$)}
  \label{iter}
\end{figure}\vskip 3pt
Fig \ref{iter} depicts the named iteration indices $0,1,2,3,7,11$ (cycles) for the propagation scheme for a circular pulse stimulus which gets turned off after 1 iteration to demonstrate raw energy spreading in the field (impulse response of the algorithm). In step 1 one can observe the placing of cosine lobes scaled with the respective accumulated and weighted energy for the summed area in each of the 8 neighbor directions. In the subsequent steps, remark the evolution from an 8-neighborhood in step 1 to a circular shaped torus.

As already mentioned, a dual-buffer approach is chosen here, as we can efficiently propagate from one into the other and just swap pointers to 
start all over (after reinitialization) until convergence. Another reason is it yields a reasonable source-target or read-write segmentation. We introduce a new operator called \textit{propagate}, permitting us to pre-define the propagation in a symbolic manner. The propagation definition denotes the transformation from one grid (A-buffer) into another (B-buffer) through proper application of the \textit{propagate}-operator to each cell. We will extend this operator with a normalization correction in sect. \ref{sec:trans} in form of a precise mathematical formulation respectively. For now, just imagine the approach in raw operating mode, with no tensor influence incorporated. That is, evaluating and accumulating the polar profiles, weighting with the linear combination weights and scaling and placing of a cosine lobe to the respective neighbor. For now, we want to define our operator $\mathop{propagate}$: Each Grid or Buffer is basically a set of cells defined as $\mathcal{C} = \{\mathbf{c}_1, \mathbf{c}_2, ..., \mathbf{c}_i\}$.  The dual buffer result $\mathcal{C'}$ is denoted symbolically as follows for all cells with a mean intensity greater than zero (those which do not contain trivial null samples):
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{C'} = \mathop{propagate}\{c_i\in \mathcal{C} \ \mid \ |\mean{I}_i| > 0\} \hskip 5pt {\forall } \ i \in [1,\mathop{dim}].
\end{align}
where: $i$: cell index, $I$: source buffer radiant intensity\vskip 5pt
The dual buffer result $\mathcal{C'}$ denotes the set of all transformed cells after the propagation, i.e., after applying the operator $\mathop{propagate}$ to each cell. This result is generated once in each iteration and gets pushed back and forth between the 2 buffers. Note that, $\mathop{dim}=width\cdot height$, which equals the tensor field resolution in this case. At last, we define a threshold for the minimum overall distribution error for the total radiant flux taken into account for a convergence criterion, initiating a stop sequence when falling below that threshold $\epsilon$ (, e.g., $0.5$) :\\
\paragraph{Criterion:}
\begin{align*}
	\Delta \Phi_{total} &= \sum_{c_i\in\mathcal{C}}\lvert\Delta I_i(\omega)\rvert = \sum_{c_i\in\mathcal{C}} \int_0^{2\pi} \lvert(I'_i(\omega)-I_i(\omega))\rvert \mathop{d\omega}  \overset{!}{<} \epsilon\\
\end{align*}
where $\phi_{total}$: total radiant flux, $I'$: target buffer radiant intensity\vskip 5pt
Note that we take the absolute value of the differences to prevent from mutual compensation.

Until now, we aimed to simulate the propagation of light in empty space (vacuum) providing us with a physically-motivated but very simplified base-approach. We aim to modulate the transmission of the intensities on top of the base approach with transmission profiles obtained from the tensor fields through principal component analysis, which yields ellipsoid glyph equations in the following.

\section{Transmission Profiles and Weighting Functions}
\label{sec:trans}
Note that the following considerations are only given for the tensor profile operating mode with tensor influence incorporated. To obtain a kind of footprint of the tensor field, we set up ellipse equations for each glyph representation, obtained from applying PCA on each cell (tensor) in the grid. Concurrently, we extend our abstract mathematical operator \textit{propagate}, previously referenced in sect \ref{sec:scheme}, by a normalization strategy necessary for windowing weighting profiles, as it is the case for our elliptical transmission profiles, which we will capture in the following. At this point, we presume the precomputation of singular value decomposition and linear combination weights. We map the singular values (corresponding to eigenvalues $\lambda$ here for simplicity) in decreasing order to the ellipses radii (half-axes) $a(\Delta x)$ and $b(\Delta y)$ as follows:

Ellipse Equation:
\begin{align}
	r(\omega) = \frac{ab}{\sqrt{a^{2}\sin^{2}(\omega-\varphi)+b^{2}\cos^{2}(\omega-\varphi)}} =\frac{\lambda_1\lambda_2}{\sqrt{\lambda_1^2\sin^2(\omega-\varphi)+\lambda_2^2\cos^2(\omega-\varphi)}}.
\end{align}
That is, the singular values form the half-axes of the PCA ellipsoid, which yields us a symbolic definition for our transmission (transfer) functions as weighting profiles which we can now evaluate as a parsing and accumulating step. We compute the offset angle $\varphi$ w.r.t. the x-axis by exploiting the $\mathop{atan2}$-function with 4-quadrant evaluation for the first singular vector (ordered decreasingly in value), since we scale the $x$-axis with the first singular value. As a preliminary preparation, this profile is precomputed (sampled) for all discrete angular steps for each cell (, e.g., $360$) and stored for reuitilization as it is the case for the previously mentioned linear combination weights as well. The weighting scheme which we apply is depicted in Fig. \ref{weighting}.
\begin{figure}[!t]
  \centering
  {
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]
    {img/polarplot.pdf}
  }
  \caption{red: Intensity Profile, cyan: Transmission Profile (glyph Ellipsoid Eq.)}
  \label{weighting}
\end{figure}
We interpret the polar functions as discrete, sampled 1D vectors with a uniform angular resolution. That means, we can use element-wise multiplication for the 1D-vectors in red (Intensity Profile) and cyan (Transmission Profile) to obtain a windowed version of the intensity profile and perform the following integration step to accumulate the total radiant power (flux) as follows. Note that we model angular dependent radiant intensity ${I}(\omega) [\frac{W}{\mathop{rad}}]$ as an underlying physical entity, which is well suited for describing point light sources. As a side note, the physical quantity perceived as brightness by human eyes, is the radiance (luminance), which is yielded by relating radiant intensity to a finite sensitive area ($[\frac{W}{\mathop{rad}}/m^2]$). The primary definition for our total accumulated incident radiant flux (again presuming that the cone is given in local coordinates - i.e. centered around the origin) is then denoted as:

\begin{align}
	\Phi_{\alpha} &= \varepsilon_\alpha(\int_{-\pi/4}^{-\alpha/2}{T}(\omega){I}(\omega)\mathop{d\omega}+\int_{\alpha/2}^{\pi/4}{T}(\omega){I}(\omega)\mathop{d\omega})+\int_{-\alpha/2}^{\alpha/2}{T}(\omega){I}(\omega)\mathop{d\omega}\\
	\Phi_{\beta} &= \varepsilon_\beta\int_{-\beta}^{\beta}{T}(\omega){I}(\omega)\mathop{d\omega}
\end{align}

This permits us to scale an oriented and clipped cosine-lobe $\cos_+$ with the total radiant flux w. respect to its own total energy when integrated likewise. A discrete cosine lobe never reaches its theoretical sum of $2$ exactly in the interval $[{-\frac{\pi}{2}},{\frac{\pi}{2}}]$. Therefore it needs to be computed to account for sampling (discretization) errors and normalized by following relation (, e.g., $\sum_{\cos} \approx 1.9949204635834517$).
\begin{align}
\sum_{\cos_+} &= \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\cos_+(\omega)\mathop{d\omega} \approx 2,\\
	\cos_k(\omega) &= \frac{\Phi_t}{\sum_{\cos_+}}cos_+(\omega-k\cdot\frac{\pi}{4})\hskip 20pt w. \ k\in[0,7].
\end{align}
This specific profile is injected in form of a placement to the corresponding neighbor index $k$. It yields a cosine lobe, which has an overall energy of $\Phi_t$, if the point light is interpreted with a Lambert-emitter (cf. \cite{lindlein}) characteristic (as part or area element of a diffusely reflecting surface) since the intensity profile matches a cosine in this case. This emitter characteristic is the case for global illumination diffuse indirect illumination (non-specular). It is used in similar style by Dachsbacher et al. for propagating intensities through LPVs (light propagation volumes).
But caution, we should not generate any exceeding energy right? Now each tensor ellipse equation has a mean transmission rate $[\%]$, which turns out to be a measure or synonym for the total rate of the outgoing transmitted radiant intensity $\int_0^{2\pi}{T}(\omega)\mathop{d\omega}$. Since energy can not be generated from transmission profiles (only transmitting, not generating), we have to normalize every tensor ellipse equation with the highest mean transmission rate in the field, which is then transmitting the whole outgoing intensity $\int_0^{2\pi}{I}(\omega)\mathop{d\omega}$ in total. This restricts the tensor ellipse mean to a maximum of $100\%$ for the tensor with the highest tensor magnitude. We will use the self-made definition of mean tensor magnitude $\mean{r}_{max}$ obtained from the PCA here for simplicity. That is, we take the principal component ellipsoid and calculate its analytical mean, which is then used for mean normalization to $\mean{r}_{max}=1.0$. Hence the tensor ellipse equations are normalized through the following step:
\begin{align}
	r_n(\omega) = \frac{1}{\mean{r}_{max}}r(\omega).
\end{align}
Notice, that this implements the concept of absorption implicitly, because tensors with a lower mean $\mean{r}$ than $100\%$ absorb energy wheras absorption equals ${\mu} = {1}-{\mean{r}}$ here. Now that we have coped with the problem of overall transmission, we are left with another problem that occurs with the weighting functions as they can still yield values above $1.0$. Consider following examples as $T(\omega)I(\omega)$ pairs (obviously normalized to $1.0$): $1.5\cdot 1.5=2.25$ and $0.5\cdot 0.5=0.25$, which disproves us that a mean $\bar{r}=1.0$ necessarily effects a mean transmission intensity $I_t$ of $1.0<1.25=\frac{2.5}{2}$. This would potentially generate intensity out of nothing which leads to crucially unstable behaviour, since we employ uncontrolled sources of energy in this case. Well, but only in case energy conservation principles were not respected.  To construct a solution, we ask for the source of the excessive energy. If the tensor mean complies with the constraint $\mean{r}\leq 1.0$, then the energy must lack in some other place (since the overall transmission fulfills the energy conservation constraint in that case). The only problem is that a normalization condition in usual style for the transmission profile ${T}(\omega)$ does not necessarily imply the same normalization for the term ${T}(\omega){I}(\omega)$. However, a proper normalization can provide corrective support, wich reveals another subsequent normalization constraint. The normalization factor is defined in 3 subsequent steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Normalization of $TI$ to $\overline{TI}=1.0$
	\item Subsequent scaling w. mean intensity $\mean{I}$ for energy conservation principles
	\item Subsequent scaling w. mean tensor magnitude $\mean{T}$ for absorption principles
\end{enumerate}

Hence the transmitted outgoing intensity for a single direction is defined as:

\begin{align}
    {I}_t(\omega) = 
\begin{cases}
   n_f\varepsilon_\alpha{T}(\omega){I}(\omega),& \text{if } k\bmod 2 = 0\\
     n_f\varepsilon_\beta{T}(\omega){I}(\omega),              & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align}

This transforms our equation for the transmitted radiant flux into:
\begin{align}
	\Phi_{\alpha,t,i} &= \int_\alpha{I}_{t,i}(\omega)\mathop{d\omega} = n_f\Phi_{\alpha,i},\\
	\Phi_{\beta,t,i} &= \int_\beta{I}_{t,i}(\omega)\mathop{d\omega} = n_f\Phi_{\beta,i}.
\end{align}
Which is now respecting energy conservation principles very conveniently, as all we need is a set of means and we are capable of normalizing the weighted intensity profile transmitted. This collapses our abstract mathematical operator $\mathop{propagate}$, which is applied to each cell, into the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Computation of normalization factor $n_f$
	\item Direction (component)-wise weighting to account for shared part in diagonal cones
	\item Integration (accumulation) of total radiant flux weighted with \underline{normalized} transmission profiles inside the angular neighbor range (read-access)
	\item Scaling of cosine lobe corresponding to neighbor direction and subsequent placing (injection) to corresponding neighbor (write-access)
	
\end{enumerate}
Remember that this operator needs to applied once to each cell to form a whole propagation cycle propagating intensities from source to target buffer. This approach ensures that no energy will be generated and therefore implements the 	physical law of energy conservation or Kirchhoff's current law if you want to think of a particle's diffusion process. Consequently, this allows us to assume that all sources of power (energy) are user-defined. In fact the approach has proven to be robust w.r.t. energy losses for several iterations as depicted in chap. \ref{chap:eval} in the stochastic error graph.

\section{Physical Model}
\label{sec:model}
To constitute a physical interpretation for the transmission of the tensor field, we imagine a melting crystal with  fibrous structures aligning with the major eigenvectors of the tensor field. This is what we call the footprint of the tensor field. In that sense of imagination, we would virtually imprint every tensor field into a crystalline structure as a preliminary initialization step. For an every day example, this can be observed in, e.g., the gemstone tiger's eyes' cat's eye effect, where crystal fibers align with the crystal axes respectively and effect a brightened line which never changes position or orientation when rotating the crystal. These oriented crysal fibers are then representing the biased propagation directions of light inside of the crystal lattice. The propability density function $P(\omega)$, for a photon being scattered in a particular direction $\omega$ \ref{ryder}, is then described as:
\begin{align}
 	P(\omega) &= \frac{T(\omega)}{\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi}T(\omega)\mathop{d\omega}}\\
 	w. \int_0^{\pi} P(\omega) &= 1.
\end{align}
This propability density function (PDF) indicates, whether there is directed anisotropy or spherical isotropy w.r.t the neighboring $180$ ($\pi \mathop{rad}$) degrees and how likely the spontaneuos scattering of a photon in this particular direction will happen. Each tensor is then a unique footprint which can be precomputed for convenience and described as polar profile just as our previously mentioned intensity profiles. We apply these polar profiles in a sense of transmission profiles as discussed in sect. \ref{sec:trans}.

\section{Light Propagation Scheme Behaviour}
To evaluate the plausibility of the light distribution results obtained from the light propagation scheme, we plot the transmission profiles overlaid with the resulting intensity profiles for several synthetic test fields, whereas red: tensor glyphs (transmission profiles) and blue: intensity profiles are both depicted in polar coordinates:
\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
  \begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}

  \begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/isotropic-all-center.png}
    \label{b)}
    \caption*{light src in center}
  \end{minipage}
\caption{final light propagation distributions for ``isotropy''-testfield}
\label{isotropic}
\end{figure}
One can observe here, how light is propagated with no directional bias leading to an absolutely isotropic distribution in case  b), which is symmetric as expected. This result is considered to be the absolute ground truth example for the light propagation scheme, which is evaluated separately in sect. \ref{sec:att} and \ref{sect:conserve}. We can also depict the final distribution as a scalar field when using the total energy in each cell as scalar:

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
  \begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/iso_scalar.png}
    \label{a)}
    \caption*{light src in center}
  \end{minipage}
  \begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/iso_sat.png}
    \label{b)}
    \caption*{light src in center (rescaled)}
  \end{minipage}
\caption{final light distributions for ``isotropy''-test field}
\label{rings-tests}
\end{figure}
Note that we skipped the top center example, since we consider it a trivial add-on example. When we observe these scalar heat map plots, we first notice the red dots, which always represent light sources (since they are captured the most energy) in these cases. Specifically, the heat maps are obtained from the same light distributions we plot as polar profiles and should hence be interpreted concurrently. Remark the propagation front indicating a circular wave (circular isolines in a)).
In this next example, we use the tensor field ``rings'' as input data for the approach and observe how the intensities are channeled in a circular orbit around the central origin. The anisotropy measures decide whether the transmission profile is more narrow (radical) or more wide (liberal):
\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
  \begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/rings-two-special1.png}
    \label{a)}

    \label{b)}
    \caption*{symmetric light src's}
  \end{minipage}
\caption{final light propagation distributions for ``rings''-test field}
\label{rings-tests}
\end{figure}
We consider Fig. \ref{rings-tests} to regard the behavior for circular tensor field lines. As expected, the intensities get directed in circular orbits by the tensor ellipsoid transmission profiles. Note the symmetry for both cases depicted. Again, we plot the final light distributions as heat maps:
\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
  \begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/cos_parallel.png}
    \label{a)}
    \caption*{antisymmtric light src's}

  \begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}

    \label{b)}
    \caption*{symmetric light src's}
  \end{minipage}
\caption{final light propagation distributions for ``spiral''-test field}
\label{spiral-tests}
\end{figure}
It is noticeable, that the intensities concentrate preferably on the circular tensor field lines, which proves the approach's controlling ability expressing as direction.
The results for our tensor field ``spiral'' can be interpreted in analogous fashion as the previously discussed ``rings''-testfield. The influence incorporated by the tensor field is easily noticeable in this case as well:
\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
  \begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/spiral-two-dense.png}
    \label{a)}
    \caption*{dense light src's}

  \begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}

    \label{b)}
    \caption*{symmetric light src's}
  \end{minipage}
\caption{final light propagation distributions for ``spiral''-test field}
\label{spiral-tests}
\end{figure}
For the ``spiral'' tensor field we observe the spiral shape literally absorbing the intensities into its spiral arms, which becomes even more clear when we again observe the heat map representation:
\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
  \begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/spiral-temp2.png}

    \label{b)}
    \caption*{four light src's}
  \end{minipage}
\caption{final light propagation distributions for ``spiral''-test field}
\label{spiral-tests}
\end{figure}

The star example reveals another interesting feature of the approach: if the intensity impulsively hits an isotropic region, it gets directed according to its intensity profile (neglecting the transmission profile) which implements the principle of inertia for directed light propagation present in vacuum (light never changes its direction):
\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
  \begin{minipage}{0.31\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/star-0,0.png}
    \label{a)}
    \caption*{single light src}

    \label{c)}
    \caption*{dual light src's}
  \end{minipage}
\caption{final light propagation distributions for ``star'' test field}
\label{spiral-tests}
\end{figure}
Remark, that the diagonal intensities are attenuated more strongly by default, which introduces a bias into the light paths which are chosen along the axes with higher propability, effectively. This gets even clearer, when we plot the heat map depiction again:
\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
  \begin{minipage}{0.31\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/star_wide.png}
    \label{a)}
    \caption*{symmetric light src's}

    \label{b)}
    \caption*{dual light src's}
  \end{minipage}
\caption{final light propagation distributions for ``star'' test field}
\label{spiral-tests}
\end{figure}
Note that we skipped the single light source example, since we consider it a trivial add-on example. We can regard the intensities condensed inside of a narrow beam of light.
Note, that a logarithmic scale needs to be incorporated to produce results on a large scale in a sense of higher spatial resolution (e.g. $101\times 101$), since the propagation attenuation follows the distance to the origin inversely proportional.

\section{Light Transport Gradient (LTG)}
\label{sec:ltg}
Now, that we are able to propagate intensity in grid, directed by the eigenvectors of the tensor field, we aim to do something more elaborate to segment ROIs (regions of interest) characterised by divergence/convergence of tensor field lines and drastic changes in anisotropy. For that we imagine kind of a local and spatial gradient, as we place light sources in two close-by positions and eventually in two close-by directions and analyze the resulting final light distribution. We consider the light distributions and their difference image for the drain test field (cf. Fig. \ref{drain} in sect. \ref{chap:grundlagen}) to have an idea, for which kind or types of cases/configurations we obtain inherently different light distributions in particular. We choose to use this test case, because it constitutes an absolutely pure example par excellence for a FTLE computation exposing raw tensor field lines diverging.  Fig. \ref{evolution} depicts final light distributions (cf. sect. \ref{sec:ltg} Fig. \ref{rings-tests}) for placing the light source one step to the left and one to the right from the central axis. We can observe the light cones cancelling out each other in the center of the difference image. That is, per default, light distributions cancel each other out for the same light source position and direction (or for continous overlaps). In this case, for the \enquote{drain} test field, we have tensor field lines diverging leading to a strong difference for light sources in finite distance, which form these curves.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
  \begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ftle_left.png}
    \label{a)}

    \caption*{difference image for a) and b)}
  \end{minipage}
  \caption{``drain'' test field}
\label{evolution}
\end{figure}

The complementing idea for the angular domain would be placing the light source at the same position but pointing in differing directions:
\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
  \begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ftle_leftangle.png}

    \label{b)}
    \caption*{difference image for a) and b)}
  \end{minipage}
  \caption{``drain'' test field}
\label{evolution}
\end{figure}

Now imagine we would accumulate the differences and assign each position a gradient magnitude in form of a scalar value with the summed difference of the final light distributions in the neighborhood. Well, we would obtain another scalar field considered to be the gradient image of the light distributions. We could very well extend this process for every light source direction discretized (sampled) and obtain a $3D$ volume representing the topological structure of the tensor field for every direction. All we need, is a formal definition for a central differences gradient approximation for light distributions given in polar profiles.

Remark that we denote the final buffer result $\mathbf{b}=\mathcal{C}_{final}$ in the following.
\subsection{Definition}
 As tensor field lines are bidirectional, convergence and divergence can not reasonably discerned in that case. We aim to extract ridges from a FTLE-like field to grasp the key regions separating anisotropy behavior (that is, changes in direction/tensor magnitude) in the field segmented as height ridges in the field, which are in turn LCS (Lagrangian Coherent Structures) well known for their rich substance in physical meaning. They often indicate transport barriers in flow fields. The nature and location of these structures and their interaction with each other is subject to the study of both turbulent and laminar mixing. They can even be observed in nature for, e.g., vortices in flow fields. For this purpose, we will use our, previously defined, $\mathop{propagate}$-operator, i.e., the propagation scheme from sect. \ref{sec:scheme} and \ref{sec:trans}, on every possible light source location $\mathbf{x}$ and direction $\omega$ in the grid to obtain the final set of buffers $\mathcal{B} = \{\mathcal{C}_1, \mathcal{C}_2, ..., \mathcal{C}_j\}$ of impulse responses of the algorithm. That is, we initialize the grid with every possible light source configuration and compute a whole final light distribution for each step:
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{B} = \mathop{propagate}\{c_i\in \mathcal{C} \ \mid \ |\mean{I}_i| > 0\} \ {\forall } \ i \in [1,\mathop{dim}] \ {\forall } \ j \in [1,\mathop{dim}\cdot \mathop{steps}].
	\label{ftle}
\end{align}
Whereas $j$ is the index of light source position and direction representing the initialization in each iteration and $\mathop{steps}$ is the count of the discrete angular steps. The initialization is done by placing a light src (delta-impulse) with $\mean{I}_i = 1.0$ at the exact location of index $j$ realizing a light source at location $(x\mid y)$ in direction $\omega$. Eq. \ref{ftle} now denotes the set of buffers $\mathcal{B}$ containing light distributions propagated from, i.e., computed for every possible direction and location. Now, that we have measured impulse responses from every location in our long 1D sample vector, we can incorporate finite (central) differences to obtain the gradient of the set of final buffers with final light distributions as elements $\mathcal{C}_{final}=\mathbf{b}\in\mathcal{B}$. Note that we interpret a finite set $\mathcal{C}_{final}$ as a vector of cells $\mathbf{b}$ with concurrent indices here:
\begin{align}
	\nabla \mathbf{b}_{x,y,\omega} =
	\begin{pmatrix}
	\frac{\partial \mathbf{b}_{x,y,\omega}}{\partial x} \\ \frac{\partial \mathbf{b}_{x,y,\omega}}{\partial y} \\ \frac{\partial \mathbf{b}_{x,y,\omega}}{\partial \omega}
	\end{pmatrix} \approx
	\frac{1}{2}
	\begin{pmatrix}
	\sum_{\mathbf{c}}\lvert \mathbf{b}_{x+1,y,\omega} - \mathbf{b}_{x-1,y,\omega}\rvert \\ \sum_{\mathbf{c}}\lvert \mathbf{b}_{x,y+1,\omega} - \mathbf{b}_{x,y-1,\omega}\rvert \\ \sum_{\mathbf{c}}\lvert \mathbf{b}_{x,y,\omega+\pi/6} - \mathbf{b}_{x,y,\omega-\pi/6}\rvert
	\end{pmatrix} =
	\frac{1}{2}
	\begin{pmatrix}
	\sum_{\mathbf{c}\in \mathbf{b_x}}\lvert \mathbf{b_x}\rvert \\ \sum_{\mathbf{c}\in \mathbf{b_y}}\lvert\mathbf{b_{y}}\rvert \\ \sum_{\mathbf{c}\in \mathbf{b_{\omega}}}\lvert \mathbf{b_{\omega}}\rvert
	\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
 We choose to use a constant offset of $\frac{\pi}{6}\mathop{rad}$ for the angle because we want to prevent from generating results with content implicitly depending on the angular resolution and also since we need to exceed $\beta$ to have a uniform and consistent placing of cosine lobes (inside diagonal cones) concerning neighbor indices. Remark that the results do not depend on the spatial resolution implicitly, because increasement acts as a domain extension for and does effectively not increase the sampling rate of the propagation scheme. Also note that this step is very expensive considering runtime-costs since it follows the following runtime observation. We have $\mathop{width}\cdot \mathop{height}\cdot \mathop{steps}$ numbers in the grid and on top $\mathop{width}\cdot \mathop{height}\cdot \mathop{steps}$ buffers in total, which need to be processed. Also we remark the convergence criterion, which introduces another heuristic factor $\mathop{width}$, because the propagation cycle count rises until the state of equilibrium is reached, and set $\mathop{height}=\mathop{width}$ here for simplicity, which yields:
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{O}(\mathop{width}\mathop{width}\mathop{steps}\mathop{width}\mathop{width}\mathop{steps}\mathop{width}) = \mathcal{O}(\mathop{width^5}\mathop{steps^2}),
\end{align}
which is the runtime behavior in order notation considering memory consumption and iteration step count. It is noticeable that the runtime increases fast with increasing resolution, which makes parallelization algorithms a crucial tool necessary to compute the results in reasonable time with additional computing power provided by a computer cluster. Next, we compute the Euclidean norm of the light transport gradient yielding a scalar field, which can be visualized directly or via extracted ridges in a visualization framework like ParaView from VTK format:
\begin{align}
	\lvert\nabla \mathbf{b}_{x,y,\omega}\rvert = \sqrt{(\frac{\partial \mathbf{b}_{x,y,\omega}}{\partial x})^2 + (\frac{\partial \mathbf{b}_{x,y,\omega}}{\partial y})^2 + (\frac{\partial \mathbf{b}_{x,y,\omega}}{\partial \omega})^2}.
\end{align}
Note that the resulting scalar field is $(n+1)$-dimensional ($x,y$ and direction $\theta$) and needs to be flattened by averaging or projection in 3D for proper visualization in case the approach will be adopted in $3D$. 


\subsection{Functionality}
We will try to show the functionality of the method in a few simple examples. As a little warmup, we will have an experiment exhibting bare, raw tensor field lines diverging w.r.t. the $y$-axis:

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
  \begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}\bigskip
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/drain(alt)-TFL.png}

    \caption*{b) LTG($90^\circ$) for a)}
  \end{minipage}
  \caption{``drain'' test field}
\label{ftle_base}
\end{figure}
What we can observe here, is a feature called a ``ridge'' occuring as a high value line segment (red vertical track) which is already quite obvious for human vision. A gradient filter could be applied to extract and segment edges from the image as a preprocessing step for computer vision, which would look like the image in Fig. \ref{gradb)}:
\begin{figure}[!t]

    \label{gradb)}
    \caption*{b) gradient for a)}
  \end{minipage}
  \caption{``drain'' test field}
\end{figure}

 These ridges represent ROIs with underlying Lagrangian Coherent Structures, which we already discussed in sect. \ref{sect:motiv}. It could for example represent a stress field inside of a mechanical tool with a central axis with maximum stress condensation.

\begin{figure}[!t]

  \begin{minipage}[!t]{0.4\textwidth}

    \caption*{b) LTG($90^\circ$) for a)}
  \end{minipage}
  \caption{``inverse''-test field}
\label{inverse-ftle}
\end{figure}

We also evaluated the approach for the ``inverse'' test field, whereas we can observe height ridges for the $90^\circ$ slice in any position with diverging tensor field lines w.r.t. the light source direction. This is certainly not the case for the upper (missing) ridge whereas tensor field lines converge with respect to the UP ($90^\circ$) direction. This proves that the method is capable of detecting ridges orthogonal to the light source direction, but not in antiparallel directions, which exhibit converging tensor field lines as bidirectional counterpart. Luckily, we measured the gradient for every possible sampled light source direction which complements this information into another slice (and the resulting volume of stacked slices). As we are also interested in the whole ensemble of directions, we can use a volume or surface representation for the $n+1=3$-dimensional grid which results from our FTLE computation. As a subsequent step, we segment height ridges in $3D$ as thresholded volumes from the whole volume grid. The volume grid is what we call the final footprint of the tensor field which is necessarily derived from the initial glyph footprint. From it, we can observe the behavior of the tensor field for any direction. We consider extracted subsets of the volume grid as $3D$ height ridges in the domain of $\omega$. That is, the slices we observed are stacked along the $z$-axis in the following:

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
  \begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[height=\textwidth]{img/inverse_isovolum2.png}
    \label{a)}
  \end{minipage}
  \begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}

    \label{b)}
  \end{minipage}
   \begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[height=\textwidth]{img/inverse_contour.png}
    \label{b)}
  \end{minipage}
    \caption{IsoVolume Filter on LTG volume representation: ``inverse'' test field}
\label{inverse_contour}
\end{figure}
Note that the $z$-axis represents the light source direction angle $\omega$ in this case. The contour filter reveals the star-shaped structure of the tensor field which rotates along the angle axis. This is the effect we already captured for the single slice: For each axis direction we can detect ridges in parallel and orthogonal to our predefined stimulus (light source) direction, but not in antiparallel direction. This causes the star shape to miss one branch or ray which is in turn the antiparallel direction missing for each light source direction emphasizing the impression of rotation. We can also try to segment height ridges represented as surfaces from the resulting volume grids as depicted in Fig \ref{inverse_surface}:

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
  \begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[height=\textwidth]{img/inverse_surface.png}
    \label{a)}

    \label{b)}
  \end{minipage}
    \caption{LTG stacked slice surface representations: ``inverse'' test field}
\label{inverse_surface}
\end{figure}

For the ``inverse'' test field, we can observe a 3 part ``rotor'' indicating the ridges which are in parallel or orthogonal to the current light source (slice) direction. This rotor can be obtained by applying a contour filter, but it can also be visualized by applying a simple thresholding on the surface representation of the volume, as depicted in Fig. \ref{inverse_surface}. Next, we will analyze the ``drain'' test field in similar fashion:

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering

     \caption{Contour filter on LTG volume representation}
    \label{b)}
  \end{minipage}
\label{drain_contour}
\end{figure}
For the ``drain'' test field we consider the central channel which produces a clear line in the cross section. The light transport gradient responds most inside of the channel region and on the top T-arms independently of the stimulus direction.

\chapter{Implementation}
\label{chap:imp}
In this chapter, we will describe the implementation process from top to bottom following runtime chronology. At first, we will load a configuration file setting angular resolution in (discrete) steps, which are spaced uniformly over the interval $[0,2\pi]$. The threshold for the convergence criterion was empirically determined and set in the range $[0.5,2.0]$. Since it is an energetic threshold, it is only dependent on the light source magnitude and not on any type of resolutions. An iteration limit is set to $\mathop{limit}=10\mathop{width}$ (e.g. for $\mathop{width}=10\cdot 100=1000$)  to prevent the approach from eventual oscillation behavior for intensities and hence overpropagation (propagating for too many timesteps). The spatial resolution is inferred by the tensor field reader method from the tensor field (see Propagation below). The light source profile can be defined for the \enquote{non-FTLE} mode where the user sets position and polar profile of single or multiple light sources as a symbolic term: ,e.g., \texttt{clip(cos(theta-pi/2))} for a Lambert-emitter pointing upwards. After the configuration read process is finished, we allocate memory for certain buffers holding glyph and intensity information with a dimension of $\mathop{dim}=\mathop{width}\mathop{height}\mathop{steps}$. This $1D$ buffer is interpreted like this:

\end{figure}\vskip 3pt
Fig. \ref{indices} depicts the \textit{deltaIndex}-map for computing the destination index for the scaled cosine lobes for cell $c$. The size of each cell is $\mathit{size}=\mathit{steps}$ in a $1D$ buffer arrangement, respectively.
We then initialize energetic sums and thresholds and run a while loop until the convergence criterion is met. We compute the difference $\Delta\Phi_{total}$ of the energetic sum in this iteration with the one from the last. If it falls short of this threshold, we initiate a stop sequence and leave the loop. To compute the FTLE, we use multiple stimuli in parallel (,e.g., Dirac-pulses within the scope of this work), and just compute the differences in light distributions for close-by light source positions and directions

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
Note that we set the light source intensity to constant value $\mathit{steps}$ to require a mean intensity of $\mu_I=1.0$ comparable to the one of a unit circle independently of the angular resolution.

\paragraph{Propagation}
The method performing the light propagation, was implemented in a separate class called propagator, which we can initialize once for each programming thread (, which we can in turn provide with its own buffer memory). As an initialization we fill the buffers with zeros to have a blank buffer initially to fill up with meaningful intensity profiles. The transmission profiles are generated by loading the tensor field in memory, performing PCA on each of them and exploiting the thin $\mathbf{U}$-matrix for the first (greater) singular vector. The resulting principal component ellipsoid equation is precomputed, sampled and stored for reuse once for each cell.  We again sample cosines into each direction, average out their integrals (sums) and normalize each of them with the mean to have the integral energy scaled to $1$ (identity element for multiplication, as it is the case for \enquote{scaling the cosine lobes} here). Thus we ensure, that the transmitted energy is approximately $1.0=100\%$ for each lobe and account for angular sampling errors.  Now we need to precompute and store the linear combinations used for the \enquote{shared part} in diagonal cones. When hitting border cells, we propagate the intensities only to the present neighbor directions still located on the grid. Remark, that we can not just ignore the edges of the grid because it would lead to large trivial intensity differences on grid borders for the FTLE-similar approach LTG.

 \EndFor
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\paragraph{Languages and Libraries}
At first, we needed to generate convenient test cases, which we design using Mathematicas VectorPlot, used to visualize vector fields. To output a pre-defined test case, we need to define a little code, which we do using python scripts which do output VTK appended or ASCII format files. To implement the method we used C++'s STL for every dynamic memory (buffer), SFML to plot polar profiles, Eigen to perform matrix decompositions and VTK to in- and output VTK format files, which can in turn be visualized and explored interactively with the visualization framework ParaView. The user functions defined in the configuration file are read-in by a string parser (muParser Library), which is used just once for sampling the polar profile and storing the precomputed result. This causes a convenient input mechanism for stimuli, in case they should be predefined.

\chapter{Results and Evaluation}
\label{chap:eval}
\section{Propagation Attenuation}
\label{sec:att}
It can be proven that the approach follows propagation attenuation principles and follows the inverse (square in $3D$) law ($\sim\frac{1}{r}$) as observed in the graph in Fig. \ref{att}. For that, we plot the relative intensity $i_{rel}(r_{rel})$ (in relation to the intensity at position (radius) $1$ to account for the inverse square law, which holds for relative distances. We evaluate the relative intensity by forming a ratio $\frac{I(r)}{I_1}$, that relates the step intensity to the src intensity at position 1.

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \centering
 {
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]
    {img/inverse_law.pdf}
  }
  \caption{Propagation Attenuation}
  \label{att}
\end{figure}\vskip 3pt



\section{Behaviour for Total Anisotropy}
We also wanted to check for the limitations of the approach by having total linear anisotropy (the case whereas one eigenvalue $\lambda_1>0$ and the other $\lambda_2=0$) incorporated. For this we set up bidirectional Dirac-pulses as transmission profiles to have the whole energy transmitted in just one, discrete direction.
\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
  \begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/tensorfieldlines.png}
    \caption*{TFLs and glyphs}
    \label{a)}

  \begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/total_anisotropy1.png}
    \caption*{iteration $50$}
    \label{b)}
  \end{minipage}
  \begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/total_anisotropy2.png}
    \caption*{iteration $103$}
    \label{c)}
  \end{minipage}
\caption{intensity propagation in grid for total anisotropy}
\label{anisotropy}
\end{figure}
What we can observe here, is kind of a sampling drift as the approach uses 8 discrete directions to propagate averaged intensity whereas the circle uses much more (namely infinite if presumed as perfect circle). Hence, the energy can never follow a perfect circle, but at best an 8-edged octagon. This means, that there is a drift of at least two cells per diagonal (one overshoot per enter and escape each) as observable in Fig. \ref{anisotropy}. Nonetheless, the energies are transmitted in circular orbits around the circle center.	
\section{Energy Conservation Test}
\label{sect:conserve}
The energy conservation test was done in similar manner as thepropagation attenuation test in sect. \ref{sec:att}. We measure the impulse response of the algorithm for 80 iterations by summing the total energy in the grid after each iteration and comparing it to the initial energy sum (e.g. $\int_0^{2\pi}1\mathop{d\omega}=2\pi$) in iteration 0 in absolute values. This energetic error analysis yields the following graph depicted in Fig. \ref{energy}:

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \centering
 {
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]
    {img/sum_difference.pdf}
  }
  \caption{Sum Error: src intensities: red: 1.0, blue 2.0, green: 5.0}
  \label{energy}
\end{figure}

The approach remains stable until iteration 40, which is at the time (point) when the numbers are to small and get rounded down under the double machine epsilon. You can see heavy fluctuations because the numbers get rounded upwards likewise. But what is lost, is lost and can not be gained back. The error is accumulating gradually and with faster slope for higher source intensities, since floting point precision, i.e., rounding errors operate more heavily on large numbers since it is a constant relative loss leading to a greater absolute $\Delta E$.

\section{Light transport gradient (LTG)}
The light transport gradient approach, which is closely related to the FTLE approach in vector fields, is evaluated for real datasets in this section. Now, that it passed the textbook examples, we push it forward to be applied in real (measured) data to show its performance in discerning and segmenting ROIs from a brain and a break lever.

\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{chap:concl}
We have presented a presented a technique to extract meaningful structures from tensor fields, which can in turn also be used to visualize meaningful structures in $2D$ virtual geometrical scenes. To put it into context, we discussed its relations to vector field visualization techniques and other tensor field and light transport visualization methods. The visualization is derived from global light transport methods propagating intensities inside of a given Cartesian grid consisting of cells with given polar profiles respectively. Based on this propagation algorithm, we can compute a FTLE-like field on the tensor field.

One of the most relevant problems in visualization is incorporating uncertainty \cite{johnson}. Measurement or simulation errors, boundary conditions or turbulences may introduce local uncertainty, which turns into global uncertainty by moving with the flow. This introduces propability density functions (PDFs) instead of certain single trajectories into the flow field. The analogy to certain vector
