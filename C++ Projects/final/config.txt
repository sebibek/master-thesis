# This file defines the program settings and the functions to be drawn
# lines beginning with # are comments and are ignored by program
# if an option is left out, the default will be used

# set window to fullscreen
# windowed is default
# fullscreen

# set window/view size
# size 701 is default
# size 701

# slice index 36/25 -- interesting timesteps
slice 25

# threshold for propagation convergence
thresh 0.5

# enables VTK file format: reads "brain.vti" if true, "matrix.txt" if false
vtkFormat 1

# set steps for angular resolution (radres)
steps 32

# define a function for light src #n (counted chronologically/occurence-based) ## ALWAYS CLIP NEGATIVE-VALUED Functions (no negative energies/intensities) --> TODO: ERROR HANDLER
function delta(theta-pi/2)
#clip(cos(theta-pi/2))
# use 2.1 for 1/r proportionality test and 2.0 for energy conservation principles for sake of simplicity
# define light src position - 0,0 is default
pos 6,2
